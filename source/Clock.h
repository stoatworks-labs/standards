/**
	The field clock: seconds since the plugin's first frame, in double, from
	whatever the host hands SetTime.

	Three problems, all inherited from the fleet, one of them new here.

	**What unit is the host's clock in?** The FFGL header never says. Resolume
	sends milliseconds; the offline harness and oxbow send seconds. The unit is
	voted on against a steady wall clock over the first few frames (readout's
	voting, by way of cadence) and then stuck to. The harness DECLARES its
	unit, because it renders as fast as the GPU allows and there is nothing
	for the voting to measure.

	**Resolume's clock overflows a float.** It has been measured at ~499
	million ms, where a float resolves ~0.03 s -- more than a field. So the
	clock is kept as an origin and an offset in double, the field arithmetic
	downstream is in integers, and nothing absolute ever reaches a shader.

	**A field store cannot be clamped the way an envelope can.** Cadence and
	the rest clamp every frame's delta into [1/240, 1/24] s. Here that would
	be wrong twice over: the harness drives the host at 600 frames a second so
	that field instants land on host frames exactly, and a clamped delta would
	quietly run the store at a quarter speed; and a store that falls behind
	does not want to catch up field by field anyway. So a delta is believed
	unless it is backwards or longer than half a second -- a scrub, a loop, a
	stall -- in which case the clock steps on by one nominal frame and
	carries on from there. The store sees a continuous clock either way.
